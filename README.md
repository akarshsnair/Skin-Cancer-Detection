# Skin-Cancer-Detection
Skin cancer is a prevalent form of cancer that
affects millions of people worldwide. Early
detection and accurate prediction of skin cancer
can significantly improve patient outcomes and
increase the chances of successful treatment. In
recent years, machine learning techniques have
shown promising results in skin cancer prediction
based on various clinical and dermoscopic features.
This abstract presents an overview of skin cancer
prediction using machine learning algorithms. The
the study focuses on the analysis and classification of
skin lesion images obtained through non-invasive
imaging techniques. A comprehensive dataset
comprising a diverse range of benign and
malignant skin lesions are utilized for training and
evaluation. Various image processing techniques
are employed to extract relevant features from the
skin lesion images, such as color, texture, shape,
and asymmetry.

## Objective
The objective of the project is to develop a machine
learning model that can accurately classify skin images
as either cancerous or non-cancerous. The project aims
to leverage the power of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning algorithm
specifically designed for image recognition tasks.
<br>
The primary goals of this project include:
<li>Early Detection: Skin cancer, if detected early, can
significantly increase the chances of successful
treatment. The objective is to develop a model that can
detect skin cancer at an early stage by analyzing
images of skin lesions.
<li>Accuracy and Reliability: The model should achieve
high accuracy in classifying skin images as cancerous
or non-cancerous. It should be able to handle different
types of skin lesions and provide reliable results.
Automation: Automating the skin cancer detection
process using a CNN model can potentially assist
dermatologists and medical professionals in their
diagnosis. The objective is to create a tool that can
augment their expertise and provide efficient and
consistent results.
<li>Accessibility: By utilizing deep learning and CNNs,
the project aims to develop an accessible and
cost-effective solution for skin cancer detection. This
can help make skin cancer screening more widely
available, especially in areas where access to
specialized medical professionals is limited.

## Dataset
The datasets that we are using for the
project has been taken from kaggle
(Detailed Images of Skin Lesions).
